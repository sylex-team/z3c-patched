Reportlab Markup Language
=========================

This pacakge is a free implementation of the RML markup language developed by
Reportlab. Unfortunately, full compliance cannot be immediately verified,
since the RML User Guide is ambiguous, incomplete and even incorrect. This
pacakge can also not support the commercial extensions to Reportlab.

In the course of implementing the specification, I made already some
improvements for various tags and added others fully. I also tried hard to
test all features. If you have any new sample RML files that you would like to
share, please check them in.

Why reimplement RML? The other free implementation of RML tinyRML is
unfortunately pretty messy code and hard to debug. It makes it also hard to
add additional tags. However, much thanks goes to their authors, since they
have solved some of the very tricky issues.
