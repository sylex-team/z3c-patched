1.0.0 (2012-04-02)
------------------

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


0.9.1 (2010-07-22)
------------------

- I found a more complete paragraph border patch from Yuan Hong. Now the DTD
  is updated, the border supports a border radius and the tag-para.rml sample
  has been updated.

0.9.0 (2010-07-22)
------------------

- Upgraded to ReportLab 2.4. This required some font changes and several
  generated PDFs did not match, since some default fonts changed.

- Upgraded to latest lxml. This only required a trivial change. Patch by Felix
  Schwarz.

- Implemented ``linePlot3D`` directive. Patch by Faisal Puthuparackat.

- Added paragraph border support. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Bug: Fixed version number in reference.pt. Patch by Felix Schwarz.

- Bug: Write PDF documents in binary mode. Patch by Felix Schwarz.


0.8.0 (2009-02-18)
------------------

- Bug: Use python executable as a part of the subprocess command.

- Add support for RML's `pageNumber` element.


0.7.3 (2007-11-10)
------------------

- Make sure that the output dir is included in the distribution.


0.7.2 (2007-11-10)
------------------

- Upgraded to work with ReportLab 2.1 and lxml 1.3.6.

- Fix sub-process tests for a pure egg setup.


0.7.1 (2007-07-31)
------------------

- Bug: When the specified page size (within the ``pageInfo`` element) was a
  word or set thereof, the processing would fail. Thanks to Chris Zelenak for
  reporting the bug and providing a patch.


0.7.0 (2007-06-19)
------------------

- Feature: Added a Chinese PDF sample file to ``tests/expected`` under the
  name ``sample-shipment-chinese.pdf``.

- Feature: Added another tag that is commonly needed in projects. The
  ``<keepTogether>`` tag will keep the child flowables in the same frame.
  When necessary, the frame break will be automatic. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: Added the "alignment" attribute to the ``blockTable``
  directive. This attribute defines the horizontal alignment for a table that
  is not 100% in width of the containing flowable. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: When creating Chinese PDF documents, the normal TTF for Chinese
  printing is 'simsun'. However, when bold text is neeed, we switch to
  'simhei'. To properly register this, we need the
  ``reportlab.lib.fonts.addMapping`` function. This is missing in the reportlab
  RML specification, so a new directive has been defined::

    <addMapping faceName="simsun" bold="1" italic="0" psName="simhei" />

  Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Feature: The ``para`` and ``paraStyle`` directive now support the "wordWrap"
  attribute, which allows for selecting a different wrod wrapping
  algorithm. This is needed because some far-East Asian languages do not use
  white space to separate words. Patch by Yuan Hong.

- Bug: Handle Windows drive letters correctly. Report and fix by Yuan Hong.


0.6.0 (2007-06-19)
------------------

- Bug: Fixed setup.py to include all dependencies.

- Bug: Added test to show that a blocktable style can be applied multiple
  times. A user reported that this is not working, but I could not replicate
  the problem.

- Update: Updated the expected renderings to ReportLab 2.1. There were some
  good layout fixes that broke the image comparison.


0.5.0 (2007-04-01)
------------------

- Initial Release
