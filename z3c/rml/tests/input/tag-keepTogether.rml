      The &lt;keepTogether&gt; tag will keep a set of child flowables in
      the same frame as much as possible. Unlike &lt;keepInFrame&gt;, it
      will not shrink the contents to do this. It adds frame breaks when
      necessary instead.

      In this example, we try to keep 3 paragraphs together. Since they
      can not all fit into the same frame as this paragraph, they will
      all appear in the next page together.
